# CodeChef Weekly Contest Problem Review
## August 17, 3 hour Contest - K-Flip

### The Problem:
You are given a binary string *_s_* of length *_n_*, and an integer *_k_*.
For each move, you may flip all the characters within a substring of *_n_* 
that has a length of *_k_*. For instance, if the substring is '010', the
flipped string would be '101'. The objective is to create the lexicographically 
smallest number. That is, the number that has the maximum amount of '0's
before the first '1'. You can only flip each substring 1 time at most. Output
the smallest number possible as your answer.
